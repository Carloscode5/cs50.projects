Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The 1000 took a couple times to rerun since the numbers came out low then high in terms of seconds, but over all accurate predictions.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After about 5-6 tries since numbers stabilized at about that many times.
